✍️ Editing & Tracking Scripts in Git

If you're editing an existing script in a repo:

cd /path/to/your/repo

# Check status
git status

# Stage changes
git add your_script.sh

# Commit
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"

# Push to GitHub
git push

Yes, even if you're editing an existing script, you still need to run git add before committing.
